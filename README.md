## 📚 THEORY

### 📌 2D Arrays
A 2D array is a grid-like data structure where elements are stored in rows and columns.  
It is essentially an array of arrays, allowing representation of matrices and tabular data.

- Fixed dimensions defined at compile time  
- Accessed using two indices: `array[row][column]`  
- Useful for matrix operations, image processing, and tabular computations

## 🔄 Common Operations

| Operation         | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
| **Input/Output**  | Nested loops to read and display matrix elements |
| **Transpose**     | Flip rows and columns: `b[i][j] = a[j][i]` |
| **Addition**      | Element-wise sum of two matrices |
| **Multiplication**| Dot product of rows and columns |
| **Diagonal Sum**  | Sum of elements where `i == j` (and optionally `i + j == n - 1`) |
| **Row Comparison**| Compare elements of two rows for equality |

## ⚙️ Best Practices and Optimization Tips

✅ Validate matrix dimensions before performing operations.  
✅ Use nested loops carefully to avoid index mismatches.  
✅ Prefer modular code — break operations into functions for clarity.  
✅ For large matrices, consider dynamic allocation or `std::vector`.  
✅ Always initialize result matrices to avoid garbage values.

## 📋 Algorithms

### ✅ Matrix Transpose
**Algorithm:**
1. **Start**
2. Declare matrix `a[r][c]`
3. Loop through `i` and `j`:
   - Assign `b[i][j] = a[j][i]`
4. Print transposed matrix
5. **End**

---

### ✅ Matrix Addition
**Algorithm:**
1. **Start**
2. Input two matrices of same dimensions
3. Loop through `i` and `j`:
   - Add corresponding elements: `sum[i][j] = a[i][j] + b[i][j]`
4. Print result matrix
5. **End**

---

### ✅ Matrix Multiplication
**Algorithm:**
1. **Start**
2. Input matrices `A[r1][c1]` and `B[r2][c2]`
3. Check if `c1 == r2`
4. Loop through `i`, `j`, and `k`:
   - Multiply and accumulate: `C[i][j] += A[i][k] * B[k][j]`
5. Print result matrix
6. **End**

---

### ✅ Diagonal Sum
**Algorithm:**
1. **Start**
2. Input square matrix `a[n][n]`
3. Loop through `i`:
   - Add `a[i][i]` to sum
   - Optionally add `a[i][n-i-1]` for secondary diagonal
4. Print sum
5. **End**

---

### ✅ Row Comparison
**Algorithm:**
1. **Start**
2. Input matrix `a[r][c]`
3. Compare elements of row 1 and row 2
4. Print whether each element is equal or not
5. **End**

## 🧠 CONCLUSION
Two-dimensional arrays are essential for representing structured data in C++. Mastering operations like transpose, addition, multiplication, and diagonal analysis builds a strong foundation for solving matrix-based problems. Through careful indexing, validation, and use of nested loops, programmers can manipulate 2D arrays efficiently. These skills are crucial for applications in scientific computing, graphics, and data analysis, forming a bridge to more advanced topics like dynamic memory, STL containers, and algorithm optimization.
